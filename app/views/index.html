      <p>
        These following prototypes were created in support of ThoughtWorks proposal for the <a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/12107"> Department for Education, Teacher Services programme</a>.

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a class="govuk-link" href="/apply-for-teacher-training">Understanding the Apply for teacher training journey</a></h2>
          <p>We assessed the current Get into Teaching website and the application journey across the different systems.</p>
          <p>We found it difficult to get an overview of the end to end journey from establishing your eligibility to accepting an offer. We found the information about the end to end process was split across many different pages with no single page acting as an anchor. We suspect that this could be disorientating and a user would need to mentally construct for themselves, therefore putting more strain on a user and reducing digital inclusion.</p>
          <p>Our hypothesis is to that users would benefit from a single page that lists the logical flow of an application and signposts to the multiple services and pages of guidance.</p>
          
          <p>We created a <a class="govuk-link" href="/apply-for-teacher-training">prototype demonstrating how the GOV.UK step by step pattern could help join up the end-to-end journey of applying for teacher training</a>.</p>
          <p>Whilst the prototype is presented as part of GOV.UK, the same pattern could be adpted to the Get into Teaching site.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a class="govuk-link" href="/teacher-training-performance-dashboard">Measuring performance and change for teacher training recruitment</a></h2>
          <p>We have created a <a class="govuk-link" href="/teacher-training-performance-dashboard">prototype of a dashboard for the recruitment of candidates into teacher training</a>, breaking down the funnel into key metrics that would help a DfE manager understand any bottlenecks and the impact of changes or marketing campaigns.
